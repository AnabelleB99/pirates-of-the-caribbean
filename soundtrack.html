            <p class="soundtrack_text">The music of <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl</i> is credited to composers Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer. Originally Zimmer, at the time of production, was working on <i>The Last Samurai,</i> and thus declined the job. Instead, he recommended Klaus Badelt, an up-and-coming composer and member of Zimmer's film scoring company "Media Ventures." Zimmer and Badelt had also collaborated on several other scores such as <i>The Prince of Egypt, Gladiator, and Mission: Impossible 2.</i> Though Badelt took the lead on scoring the movie and is officially credited as the composer, Zimmer became entranced by the movie after an evening with director Gore Verbinski and ended up writing several of the movie's primary musical themes - over the course of the following night.</p>
