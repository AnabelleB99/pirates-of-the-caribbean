## Project Challenges
### OVERALL
- Difficulty explaining and coordinating push/pulling with group members. Some overlaps and mistakes were made (e.g. pushing to the main branch) and we had to create a separate, temporary branch to push the changes to.

### CAST
- Figuring out how to make the grid with circular images was a challenge but had been resolved. Continuing challenge not able to resolve: how to avoid stretched image within a circle; able to resize a few.

### PLOT PAGE
- Difficulty getting the text animation to work.

### SOUNDTRACK PAGE
- Trouble getting media query to work, ended up moving the code to the bottom of the stylesheet for it to function properly.
- Utilized grid at first to try and position images, but found that floats/flexbox was easier for some.
