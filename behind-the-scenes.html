               <ul>
                  <li class="bts_dyk__list">Jack Sparrow's hat had to be made out of rubber</li>
                  <p>The costumer designer, Penny Rose, showed host and co-creator Dan Lanigan the hat that Depp wore in the movie, which she mentioned was made of rubber. Reason being: the original design kept getting thrown overboard and, after losing 10 copies, she decided to craft one out of a material that would stay afloat.</p>
                  <li class="bts_dyk__list">Robert De Niro was originally offered Jack Sparrow</li>
                  <p>A number of other actors were reportedly up for/offered the role prior to Depp, including Jim Carrey, Matthew McConaughey, and (unbelievably) Robert De Niro.</p>
                  <li class="bts_dyk__list">Keira Knightly wanted to sword fight in the first film, but wasn't allowed</li>
                  <p>In an interview for the film, Knightley said, “I asked every single day, anyone I could ask, if I could have a sword but I didn't get one.”</p>
                  <li class="bts_dyk__list">It changed The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</li>
                  <p>The full-bodied skeletons in various stages of decay had an unexpected effect on The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where the filmmakers apparently had a strikingly similar design for the Army of Dead that Aragorn recruits in the third film. After seeing a trailer for Pirates, the LOTR crew decided to rework their design and come up with something totally new.
                  <li class="bts_dyk__list">The sets from the first movie are now tourist attractions</li>
                  <p>The majority of The Curse of the Black Pearl was shot in St. Vincent, a volcanic island located in the Caribbean that provided the filmmakers with the serene beaches they desired. Many of the citizens of St. Vincent were employed as crew members and extras during the shoot, and sets for both Port Royal and Tortuga were built on the island. Instead of knocking them down after the film was complete, many of the set pieces were left in place and they continue to serve as tourist attractions. </p>
